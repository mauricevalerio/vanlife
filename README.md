## Reflection
This a guided project from the Scrimba's free course [React Router](https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6) but used MirageJS to have a dummy backend. 

This was an opportunity to add a real backend web server and practice MERN stack. I was able to combine the knowledge I've gained from [MERN Auth Tutorial](https://github.com/mauricevalerio/workouts) to this project.
