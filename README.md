## Reflection
This a guided project from the Scrimba's free course [React Router](https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6) but used MirageJS to have a dummy backend. 

This was an opportunity to add a real backend web server and practice MERN stack. I was able to combine the knowledge I've gained from [MERN Auth Tutorial](https://github.com/mauricevalerio/workouts) to this project.

The interesting new thing I've learned is how to pass and use custom hooks outside a functional component such as React Router's loader and action functions.

Both projects were different, Scrimba's approach was to use the Data Layer API offered by React Router such as using the Form component, action and loader functions while MERN Auth tutorial just uses the basics of React Router and handle the rest with React hooks.
